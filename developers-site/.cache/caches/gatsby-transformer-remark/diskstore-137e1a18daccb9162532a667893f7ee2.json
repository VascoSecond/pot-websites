The APIDays Finland event is brought to you together with our local APIOps community. </p>\n<p>Traditional industries are starting to catch up with digital transformation, partly because of the Finnish and EU -level legal requirements for industries to open APIs, even for their competitors and disruptors. </p>\n<p>The most established companies and organizations are getting on board. If your digital customer experience isn't cutting it, competition is imminent.

This event is for sharing information, getting inspiration from customers, competitors and across industries, as well as experts. </p>\n<h1>Time &#x26; Place</h1>\n<p>4.-5.6.2019 Helsinki in award winning event center Koskenranta\nKatariina Saksilaisen katu 9 , 00560 Helsinki, Finland</p>\n<p> Koskenranta is an idyllic restaurant and event venue on the banks of\nVanhankaupunginkoski (Old City rapids).
