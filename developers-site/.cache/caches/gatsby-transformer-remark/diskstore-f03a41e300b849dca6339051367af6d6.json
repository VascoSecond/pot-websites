This is especially important in case of data products, as during development your access control checks etc. might not be fully complete.</p>\n<p>It is recommended that when you are integrating a data product, that you use a separate \"sandbox\" deployment for yourself as well. This way you can keep working on the \"development version\" that is tied to sandbox, while you have a stable production version deployed as well.</p>\n<h2>APIs in sandbox</h2>\n<p>The sandbox APIs and other URLs can be identified with the <code>*-sandbox.oftrust.net</code> -domain, so e.g. all the APIs for managing your data products etc. are under <code>api-sandbox.oftrust.net</code>. </p>\n<h1>Create account and get started!</h1>\n<p>Create account and start utilizing the free and open sandbox! </p>\n<p>If you are application developer, it might be a good idea to read <a href=\"/developers/getstarted/build-apps\">Application Development Guide</a> first. </p>\n<p>If you are integrating data and creating data products, take a look at the <a href=\"/developers/getstarted/data-products\">Data Product Guide</a>. </p>\n<p>Digital Twins is fundamental feature of the platform, take a look at the <a href=\"/developers/getstarted/twins\">Digital Twin Guide</a>.</p>"}
